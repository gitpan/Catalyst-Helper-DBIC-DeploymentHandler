NAME
    Catalyst::Helper::DBIC::DeploymentHandler - Create a
    script/myapp_dbicdh.pl to help manage your DBIC deployments

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
    ./script/myapp_create.pl DBIC::DeploymentHandler

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Catalyst helper module that builds a
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler script for you.

    VERY EARLY CODE: things may yet change, but shouldn't impact older
    versions (unless you regenerate the script).

TODO
    Schemas not named MyApp::DB::Schema.

    Determine the db type automatically

SEE ALSO
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler, DBIx::Class,
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Manual::CatalystIntro

CODE LINEAGE
    While I put together this helper module, this code is largely based on
    the information (and code) in
    DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Manual::CatalystIntro. Any errors are
    mine.
